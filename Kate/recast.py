We recast the integerâ€‘based columns following the logic rules outlined in the paper.
"Explainable Feature Engineering for Multi-class Money Laundering Classification" 
This recasting is performed to optimize storage efficiency and reduce overall memory consumption."
Excluding "Sender_account" and "Receiver_account" variables.
